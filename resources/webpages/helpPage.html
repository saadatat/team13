        <h4>
        <a>Basic Calculations</a>
        </h4>
        Either the keyboard or buttons in the application can be used to input numbers and values. As you type
        you will be alerted to any errors you may make. If you make a mistake the backspace button can be used.
        <br><br>
        When using real numbers, the calculator will function as a normal calculator. Answers will still be in
        standard form.
        <br><br>
        If you find youself typing a long number and do not wish to delete everything to change it's sign, you may use
        the combined plus-minus button.
        <br><br>
        This calculator supports running totals, so you can continue to run calculations using a previous answer
        as the leftmost operand in an equation.
        <br><br>
        If you wish to see an answer in it's fraction form you can toggle this feature by pressing the button marked
        <strong>D</strong>. This will then change the button so it reads <strong>F</strong>. Whatever the button displays
        at the time is what answers will be given in.
        <br><br>
        As you are entering numbers you can reset all text fields using the <strong>R</strong> button. If you just wish
        to reset your input field use the button labeled <strong>C</strong>.
        <h4>
        <a>Entering Imaginaries and Complex Numbers</a>
        </h4>
        To enter an imaginary number, type in a number followed by clicking the <strong><i>i</i></strong> button.
        <br><br>
        Using the parantheses will alter some functions on the calculator. If you use an open paranthesis the addition
        and subtraction buttons will now no longer be used the calculate entered operands. Instead, you can now
        use the addition and subtraction buttons to enter their respective characters into the input field. This allows
        you to enter in complex numbers. Using a closed paranthesis returns the calculator to it's normal function.
        Parantheses only work with complex numbers.
        <br><br>
        When entering complex numbers standard form must be used. This involves only using two operands within the parantheses
        and one operator. The first will be a real number, followed by it's imaginary counterpart.
        <h4>
        <a>History, Recording and Printing</a>
        </h4>
        This calculator will keep track of all your calculations beginning with opening the application. To view these
        you click the <strong>></strong> button to expand the history view. If you wish to close it press the <strong><</strong> button.
        <br><br>
        You may find youself wanting to save your calculations, one option is printing your result history from directly
        from rimpleX. Do this by navigating to "File" and then selecting "Print". After a moment your default system print
        dialog will appear.
        <br><br>
        If you wish to save you calculations to a file then you must first record them. To enable recording navigate to
        "File" then click "Toggle Record". If you navigate back to Toggle Record you will notice that the text now appears red.
        This indicates that the recording function is on. Press it again to turn it off and the text will also go back to
        normal reflecting this.
        <br><br>
        Any complete calculations made while recording is enabled will be saved for the duration of the program. To save
        them to your disk navigate to "File" and then "Save Recorded Calculations". After a moment a dialog will let you
        select what to name your file and where on the disk to save it.
